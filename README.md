# Python Basics: Data Type Conversions, String Formatting, and Collections (Lists, Tuples, Dicts, Sets)

## Overview

This project introduces fundamental Python concepts, including data type conversions, string formatting, and Python's built-in collection types: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets. It aims to help beginners understand basic data handling, how to perform conversions between types, and how to work with various data structures in Python.
## Key Features

* Data Type Conversions: Demonstrates conversion between integers, floats, and complex numbers.

* String Formatting: Shows how to format strings using Pythonâ€™s .format() method with examples of precision for numerical values.

* Lists: Introduction to Python lists, including adding, removing, and accessing elements.

* Tuples: Covers immutable collections in Python with examples of tuple operations.

* Dictionaries: Demonstrates key-value pairs, how to create dictionaries, and access or modify elements.

* Sets: Introduces Python sets and their usage for storing unique elements and performing set operations
## Technology Used

* Python: The primary language used to demonstrate these concepts.

* Jupyter Notebook: For writing and executing Python code interactively.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone [repository-link]

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd [project-directory]

3. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or later). You can download it from the official Python website.

4. Install Jupyter Notebook using pip if you don't already have it:
pip install notebook
    
## Run

1. Open the terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the project directory.

2. Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
jupyter notebook

3. Open the notebook file class2.ipynb to explore the code and execute the cells interactively.
## Conclusion

This project provides a beginner-friendly introduction to essential Python concepts like data type conversions, string formatting, and working with collections such as Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets. These are fundamental building blocks that are widely used in more complex Python programming tasks. Future improvements might include adding more advanced examples or exploring additional Python data structures.
